# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

My work on Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com). Started in 2015, I try it again in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, didn't do much in 2022, will try to make it better in 2023.
Mostly JS, maybe some other languages sometimes.

Starting 2022, the following commands works :

``npm run setup <day> <year?>`` : Creates the directory and files, and fetch the input puzzle for the given day (default to year 2023)

``npm run start <day> <year?> <part?>`` : Runs the given day puzzle (year default to 2024, part default to both part1 and 2).
