# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

My work on Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com). Started in 2015, I try it again in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and back again in 2022.
Mostly JS, maybe some other languages sometimes.

Starting 2022, the following commands works :

``npm run setup <day> <year?>`` : Creates the directory and files, and fetch the input puzzle for the given day (default to year 2022)

``npm run start <day> <year?> <part?>`` : Runs the given day puzzle (year default to 2022, part default to both part1 and 2).
